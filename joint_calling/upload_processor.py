""" This function prepares gVCF's uploaded to GCS, based off sample status
    logged in a database, for further QC and downstream analysis.
    The upload processor will determine when samples should be added
    to existing MatrixTables where appropriate and which MatrixTables
    they should be combined with in this case. Following a successful
    run all uploaded files will be moved to archival storage."""

        The name of the bucket where files are to be moved.

    Parameters
    ==========
    batch: hb.Batch
        An object representing the DAG of jobs to run.
    sample_files: List[str]
        A list of the file names to be moved.
        For example ["TOB1543","TOB2314","TOB3423"]
    source_bucket_name: str
        The name of the bucket where the files are initially located.
        For example "cpg-tob-wgs-upload"
    destination_bucket_name: str
        The name of the bucket where files are to be moved.
        For example "cpg-tob-wgs-main"
    docker_image: str
        The address and tag of a previously built docker image, within the
        artifact registry.
        For example;
        australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/project/images/driver:version'
    dest_path: str, optional
        The path to the specific sub-directory where the file should be moved.
        By default no sub-directory is specified. This may correspond to the version.
        For example, "/v1"
    key: str, optional
        key-file for the service account used for authentication. In the case that this
        is not provided as an input, it is assumed that this key will exist at
        gsa-key/key.json. This is the case when using the hail batch service backend.
        For example:
        "{
            "type": "service_account",
