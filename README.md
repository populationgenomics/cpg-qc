```

The `--sample-map` value is a CSV file with a header as follows:

```sh
sample,population,gvcf,contamination,alignment_summary_metrics,duplicate_metrics,insert_size_metrics,wgs_metrics
NA19238,YRI,gs://playground-au/gvcf/NA19238.g.vcf.gz,,gs://playground-au/<....>/NA19238.readgroup.alignment_summary_metrics,<...>/NA19238.duplicate_metrics,<...>/NA19238.insert_size_metrics,<...>/NA19238.wgs_metrics
```

The first column is the sample ID. The samples with data in the "population" column are used to train the random forest for population inferral of other samples.

To run using Query ServiceBackend, use:

```sh
python scripts/combine_gvcfs.py \
  --sample-map    gs://playground-us-central1/fewgenomes/50genomes-gcs-round1.csv \
  --out-mt        gs://playground-us-central1/fewgenomes/service/50genomes-round1.mt \
  --bucket        gs://playground-us-central1/fewgenomes/service/50genomes/work/round1 \
  --local-tmp-dir test/run_test/combine/50genomes/service/round1 \
  --hail-billing  vladislavsavelyev-trial \
  &
```


## Description

The pipeline consists of 3 scripts:

1. `combine_gvcfs` that takes GVCFs specified in the sample map and interatively merges them into a sparse Matrix Table using [Hail's vcf_combiner](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/experimental/vcf_combiner.html);
2. `sample_qc` that performs sample-level QC using such information as sex, coverage and intra-sample variant numbers/distributions, and flags samples that do not pass filters;
3. `variant_qc` that exports variants into a VCF for an allele-specific VQSR, and imports back into a Matrix Table to apply variant-level filters.

The pipeline's structure, and the thresholds used are largely based on [gnomAD QC tools](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gnomad_qc), which is a collection of methods used to validate and prepare gnomAD releases. We explore gnomAD QC functions [in this document](docs/gnomad_qc.md). Good summaries of gnomAD QC pipeline can be found in gnomAD update blog posts:

QC pipeline outline:

1. GVCFs are loaded into Hail with [experimental.run_combiner](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/experimental/vcf_combiner.html)

2. Compute sample QC metrics using Hailâ€™s [`sample_qc`](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/methods/genetics.html#hail.methods.sample_qc) module on all autosomal bi-allelic SNVs.

3. Filter outlier samples using the following cutoffs:

   * Number of SNVs: < 2.4M or > 3.75M
   * Number of singletons: > 100k
   * Hom/het ratio: > 3.3

4. Hard filtering using BAM-level metrics was performed when such metrics were available. We removed samples that were outliers for:

   * Contamination: freemix > 5% (`call-UnmappedBamToAlignedBam/UnmappedBamToAlignedBam/*/call-CheckContamination/*.selfSM`/`FREEMIX`)
   * Chimeras: > 5% (`call-AggregatedBamQC/AggregatedBamQC/*/call-CollectAggregationMetrics/*.alignment_summary_metrics`/`PCT_CHIMERAS`)
   * Duplication: > 30% (`call-UnmappedBamToAlignedBam/UnmappedBamToAlignedBam/*/call-MarkDuplicates/*.duplicate_metrics`/`PERCENT_DUPLICATION`)
   * Median insert size: < 250 (`call-AggregatedBamQC/AggregatedBamQC/*/call-CollectAggregationMetrics/*.insert_size_metrics`/`MEDIAN_INSERT_SIZE`)
   * Median coverage < 15X (`call-CollectWgsMetrics/*.wgs_metrics`/`MEDIAN_COVERAGE`)

5. Sex inferred for each sample with Hail's [`impute_sex`](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/methods/genetics.html?highlight=impute_sex#hail.methods.impute_sex). Removed samples with sex chromosome aneuploidies or ambiguous sex assignment.

6. Relatedness inferred between samples using Hail's[`pc_relate`](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/methods/genetics.html?highlight=pc_relate#hail.methods.pc_relate). Identified pairs of 1st and 2nd degree relatives. Filter to a set of unrelated individuals using Hail's [`maximal_independent_set`](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/methods/misc.html?highlight=maximal_independent_set#hail.methods.maximal_independent_set) that tries to keep as many samples as possible. When multiple samples could be selected, we kept the sample with the highest coverage.

7. PCA was a ran on high-quality variants, and RF was trained using 16 principal components as features on samples with known ancestry. Ancestry was assigned to all samples for which the probability of that ancestry was >75%.

8. [`sample_qc`](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/methods/genetics.html#hail.methods.sample_qc) was used stratified by 8 ancestry assignment PCs. Within each PC, outliers were filtered if they are 4 median absolute deviations (MADs) away from the median for the following metrics: `n_snp`, `r_ti_tv`, `r_insertion_deletion`, `n_insertion`, `n_deletion`, `r_het_hom_var`, `n_het`, `n_hom_var`, `n_transition`, `n_transversion`, or 8 MADs away from the median number of singletons (`n_singleton` metric).

9. For the remaining samples, export variants into a VCF.

10. Perform the allele-specific version of GATK Variant Quality Score Recalibration [VQSR](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/9622/allele-specific-annotation-and-filtering), using the standard GATK training resources (HapMap, Omni, 1000 Genomes, Mills indels), with the following features:

   * SNVs:   `AS_FS`, `AS_SOR`, `AS_ReadPosRankSum`, `AS_MQRankSum`, `AS_QD`, `AS_MQ`
   * Indels: `AS_FS`, `AS_SOR`, `AS_ReadPosRankSum`, `AS_MQRankSum`, `AS_QD`

   * No sample had a high quality genotype at this variant site (GQ>=20, DP>=10, and AB>=0.2 for heterozygotes) (all fields are populated by GATK)
   * `InbreedingCoeff` < -0.3 (there was an excess of heterozygotes at the site compared to Hardy-Weinberg expectations) (`InbreedingCoeff` is populated by GATK)
